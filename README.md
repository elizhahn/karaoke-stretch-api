## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to self-teach back-end technologies by creating a database, building out a server, and making network requests to access that data. We decided to learn PostgreSQL and Knex.js, and to build upon our understanding of Node.js and Express.js. We also built out the front-end of the application using React.js, HTML5 and CSS3/SCSS, and implemented an automated testing suite using Cypress. In summary, this is a fully tested, PERN stack application.

## Learning Goals

### Team Goals
    
 - Fill in gaps of knowledge between front-end and back-end
 - How to create a database / understand how a database works / how to hook it up with the front-end
 - How to deploy the site (full stack)
 - We'll know we're successful when we produce a fully-functional app and we all feel comfortable with our new technologies
